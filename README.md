# LAMA (Life Admin Management Advisor)

Lama is your personal reminder app (or llama) that notifies you with the important (or not important) stuff that you need to be reminded of. You will not forget again your yearly dentist visit, finish your household obligations or cancel your subscriptions service before they renew again!

You can add items inside of pools and set a date if you want to be notified. A notification will arrive by email when it's time. You can also receive all the content you have in the platform directly by email by clicking a button or setting it up to do it every X weeks.

In the next updates of LAMA you will have:
- PWA with push notifications
- Optional frequency in items for periodic reminders
- Dark mode
- and much more...

## Getting started

To install the required dependencies run `$ npm install` in both /client and /server folders.

In order to run the server you will require an `.env` file in /client containing an OpeanAI ORG, OpenAI KEY, email address and password with the right third party apps permission.
