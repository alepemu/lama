        <h3>want to know more about llamas?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Llamas are known for their spitting abilities, but they don't actually spit out of
            anger. They usually spit to communicate with each other or to express their annoyance.
            So, if a llama spits at you, it's their way of saying, "Hey, back off!"
          </li>
          <li>
            Llamas have a unique hairstyle called a "topknot." Their hair naturally grows longer on
            the top of their head, giving them a stylish and somewhat comical appearance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Llamas are excellent hikers and can navigate through rough terrains with ease. They have
            been known to climb mountains at altitudes of over 13,000 feet. Imagine a llama
            conquering the summit!
          </li>
          <li>
            Llamas are social animals and often live in herds. They have a strong sense of community
            and will even hum to communicate with each other. So, you could say they're the original
            hum-mates!
          </li>
          <li>
            Llamas have a keen sense of curiosity and are known to investigate objects by giving
            them a gentle nudge with their nose. If you leave something interesting lying around,
            don't be surprised if a llama comes up to inspect it!
          </li>
          <li>
            Llamas are environmentally friendly lawnmowers! Some people use llamas to graze on their
            lawns instead of using gas-powered mowers. It's a win-win situation: the llamas get a
            tasty meal, and the lawn gets a trim.
          </li>
          <li>
            Llamas have a reputation for being quirky and can display amusing behaviors. They often
            make funny facial expressions and have been known to photobomb unsuspecting tourists
            taking selfies. Watch out for those photogenic llamas!
          </li>
          <li>
            Llamas have a unique way of showing affection. When they're fond of someone, they may
            give them a gentle nuzzle or a "kiss" by pressing their lips against the person's cheek.
            Who wouldn't want a smooch from a llama?
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Remember, llamas are fascinating creatures with a great sense of humor. They never fail to
          bring a smile to people's faces!
